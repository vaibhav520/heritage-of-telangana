1. Birla Mandir
Dedicated to Lord Venkateshwara, Birla Mandir in Hyderabad is an architectural beauty boasting of 2000 tonnes of white marble. The temple is located on a hilltop at the height of 280 feet which makes the structure look even more incredible. Constructed by the Birla Group (who are popularly known for building temples all over the country), the temple is the ideal place for meditating, given the fact that there are no bells here. There's a bit of climbing involved in reaching this holy site. After entering the place, you get a spectacular panoramic view of Hyderabad and Secunderabad which is worth the climb you take to reach the temple.
