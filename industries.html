            <p style="position: absolute;margin-top: 200px;margin-left: 20px;">occupational hazard:<br>This could lead to chronic musculoskeletal disorders such as low back pain among bar benders. The aim of this study is to assess the ergonomics of manual bar bending and thereby develop a customized optimal workplace
                for bar bending. Biomechanical analysis was done using a three-dimensional Schultz-Andersson model to determine the influence of the diameter of the bar on the compressive force (Fc) at L5 S1. The effect of table height, grip arm distance,
                and back bend angle on Fc were also evaluated. Fc decreased up to 53%, with an increase of table height by 400 mm, and up to 41%, with an increase of grip arm distance by 500 mm; however it increased with back bend angle. Fc was higher
                than the NIOSH safety limit of (3.4 kN) in all cases except when bending 8 mm bars. A quick field reference for optimal table height and grip arm distance was prepared based on subjects' anthropometry and diameter, using Nash bargaining
                principles.
