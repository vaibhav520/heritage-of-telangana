        <h1>About language of Telangana</h1>
        <p>Telugu one of the classical languages of India is the official language of Telangana and Urdu is the second <br> official language of the state. About 77% of the population of Telangana speak Telugu and 12% speak Urdu. <br> Before 1948, Urdu was
            the official language of Hyderabad State, and due to a lack of Telugu-language educational <br> institutions, Urdu was the language of the educated elite of Telangana. After 1948, once Hyderabad State joined <br> the new Republic of India,
            Telugu became the language of government, and as Telugu was introduced as the medium <br> of instruction in schools and colleges, the use of Urdu among non Hyderabadi Muslims decreased. Both Telugu and <br> Urdu are used in services across
            the state, such as the Telangana Legislature website, with Telugu and Urdu versions <br> of the website available, as well as the Hyderabad metro, wherein both languages are used on station names and signs <br> along with English and Hindi.
            The Urdu spoken in Telangana is called Hyderabadi Urdu, which in itself is a dialect of the <br> larger Dakhini Urdu dialects of South India. Although the language is orally spoken by most Hyderabadi Muslims, the <br> language in a literary
            context has long been lost, and standard Urdu is used. Lambadi is also widely used, and Marathi <br> and Kannada predominate in border areas. Many tribal languages are also spoken, especially in Khammam, the largest <br> being Koya and Gondi.</p>
