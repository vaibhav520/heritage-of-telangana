        <h1>About folk dance of Telangana</h1>
        <p>Perini Sivatandavam or Perini Thandavam is an ancient dance from Telangana which has been revived in recent times. <br> It originated and prospered in Telangana during the Kakatiya dynasty. The Perini Thandavam is a dance form usually <br> performed
            by males. It is called 'Dance of Warriors'. Warriors before leaving to the battlefield enact this dance before <br> the idol of Lord Shiva. The dance form, Perini, reached its pinnacle during the rule of the 'Kakatiyas' who established <br>their
            dynasty at Warangal and ruled for almost two centuries. It is believed that this dance form invokes 'Prerana' (inspiration) <br> and is dedicated to supreme dancer, Lord Shiva. Bonalu The folk festival of Bonalu in the Telangana region brings
            with it<br> celebrations which see the colourfully dressed female dancers balancing pots (Bonalu), step to the rhythmic beats and <br> tunes in praise of the village deity Mahankali. Male dancers called Potharajus precede the female dancers
            to the temple <br> lashing whips and neem leaves adding colour to the festivity.</p>
